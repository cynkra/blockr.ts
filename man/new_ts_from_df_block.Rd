\title{Convert Wide DataFrame to Time Series Long Format}
\usage{
new_ts_from_df_block(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to new_ts_transform_block}
}
\description{
A transform block that converts wide-format data frames to long-format
time series data compatible with tsbox. The resulting data can be
visualized as a dygraph and used with other time series blocks.
}
\details{
This block uses tsbox::ts_long() to convert wide data frames where:
\itemize{
\item The time column is automatically detected (character, Date, POSIXct, etc. are all accepted)
\item All other numeric columns are treated as separate time series
\item The output is in long format with columns: id, time, value
}

The resulting data frame is compatible with all other ts blocks and will
be displayed as an interactive dygraph.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create sample wide data
df_wide <- data.frame(
  date = seq(as.Date("2020-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 12),
  sales = rnorm(12, 100, 10),
  revenue = rnorm(12, 1000, 100)
)

# Convert to time series format
blockr.core::serve(
  new_ts_from_df_block(),
  data = list(data = df_wide)
