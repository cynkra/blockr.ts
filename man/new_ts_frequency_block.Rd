\title{Time Series Frequency Conversion Block}
\usage{
new_ts_frequency_block(to = "year", aggregate = "mean", na.rm = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{to}{Character string specifying the target frequency:
\itemize{
\item "year": Convert to yearly data
\item "quarter": Convert to quarterly data
\item "month": Convert to monthly data
\item "week": Convert to weekly data
\item "day": Convert to daily data
}}

\item{aggregate}{Character string specifying the aggregation method:
\itemize{
\item "mean": Average values (default)
\item "sum": Sum values
\item "first": Take first value
\item "last": Take last value
\item "min": Take minimum value
\item "max": Take maximum value
}}

\item{na.rm}{Logical whether to remove NA values (default: TRUE)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to new_ts_transform_block}

\description{
A transform block that converts time series to different frequencies through
aggregation or disaggregation (e.g., monthly to quarterly, quarterly to yearly).
}
\details{
This block uses tsbox::ts_frequency() to convert time series between different
temporal granularities. When converting to lower frequencies (e.g., monthly to yearly),
data is aggregated using the specified method. When converting to higher frequencies
(e.g., yearly to monthly), data is disaggregated using interpolation.
