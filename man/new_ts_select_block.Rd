\title{Time Series Selection Block}
\usage{
new_ts_select_block(series = NULL, pattern = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{Character vector of series names to select (default: NULL)}

\item{pattern}{Regular expression pattern to match series names (default: NULL)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to new_ts_transform_block}
}
\description{
A transform block that selects specific series from multivariate time series data.
Supports both explicit series selection and pattern-based filtering.
}
\details{
This block uses tsbox::ts_pick() to select specific series from multivariate
time series data. You can either:
\itemize{
\item Explicitly select series by name (e.g., c("DAX", "FTSE"))
\item Use a regex pattern to match series names (e.g., "^D.*" for all series starting with D)
}

If both series and pattern are NULL, all series are returned.
If both are provided, series takes precedence.
}
